We may feel uncertain, anxious, or overwhelmed by the challenges that lie ahead. But in these moments, we must remember that we are not alone. We have an unshakeable fortress - our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is our Rock, our Refuge, and our Strength. When the winds of adversity howl and the waves of doubt crash against us, we can rest in the knowledge that He stands firm, unchanging and unshakeable. We can trust in His presence, His power, and His goodness. And when we do, we will find peace, hope, and courage to face whatever comes our way.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Pray for 5 minutes today, asking God to be your Rock in the midst of chaos. Write down 3 things you're grateful for about His presence in your life.\""
