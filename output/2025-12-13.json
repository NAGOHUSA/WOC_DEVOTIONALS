Life can be unpredictable and chaotic, causing us to question God's goodness and sovereignty. But the truth is, our trust should be in God, not in our circumstances. Psalm 62 reminds us that He is our refuge, our safe haven in times of turmoil. When we put our trust in Him, we can face anything that comes our way. We don't have to be shaken by the storms of life because we know that God is our rock, our fortress, and our deliverer.\n\nAs we navigate the challenges of life, let's remember to trust in God at all times. Let's pour out our hearts to Him, sharing our fears, doubts, and insecurities. And let's rest in the knowledge that He is our refuge, our strong tower, and our unwavering hope.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 wall sits today, remembering that our strength comes from God, not from our own abilities.\""
