Our jobs, finances, relationships, and health can all be sources of anxiety. But as believers, we have a choice: to let fear rule our lives or to stand firm in faith. When we present our requests to God with thanksgiving, we acknowledge His sovereignty and goodness. This isn't to say that our problems will disappear, but it does mean that we can face them with courage and confidence. Remember, God is bigger than any fear you face. He is faithful, loving, and powerful. So when fear tries to creep in, take it to the Father in prayer, and stand firm in His love.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 5 minutes to write down your fears and worries, then pray through each one, thanking God for His love and sovereignty.\""
