We are called to lead, to serve, and to be examples of Christ's love and character. This call to spiritual leadership is not a privilege reserved for the few, but a responsibility given to each of us. As we strive to live out this call, we must remember that leadership is not about titles or positions, but about character and integrity. It is about being willing to serve, to listen, and to guide others with humility and compassion.\n\nAs we seek to become the leaders God has called us to be, let us remember the example of Jesus, who came not to be served, but to serve. Let us seek to be servants to one another, to lift each other up, and to point each other to the cross.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 minutes to pray for the men in your life, asking God to give you wisdom and guidance as you seek to lead and serve them.\""
