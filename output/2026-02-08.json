The helmet of salvation reminds us that we are protected by the power of God's redemption in our lives. The sword of the Spirit is the word of God, which is our ultimate defense against the enemy's attacks. It's not just about knowing the Bible, but about living it out in our daily lives. As we put on this armor, we are empowered to stand firm against the schemes of the devil and to proclaim the gospel of salvation to a lost world. Let us remember that our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 1 mile while praying for the salvation of those around you.\""
