We're told what we should be, what we should do, and how we should live. But the Bible encourages us to be different. We're called to be transformed by the Word of God, not conformed to the world's standards. This means that our minds must be renewed, and our wills must be aligned with God's will. We must test our desires and actions against the standard of God's Word, seeking to do what is good, acceptable, and perfect in His sight. This takes discipline and perseverance, but the reward is worth it: a life that is unshakable, a life that is anchored in the firm foundation of Christ.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three areas where you've been conformed to the world, and three ways you can be transformed by the renewal of your mind this week.\""
