Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.\" – 2 Corinthians 4:16\n## Reflection\nLife can be unpredictable and turbulent at times. We face storms that test our faith, our strength, and our resolve. But as men of God, we must remain steadfast and unshakeable. We must look beyond the external circumstances and focus on the internal renewal that is taking place within us. As we walk through the storm, we can be confident that our inner self is being transformed and strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit. We must not lose heart, but rather draw strength from our faith and our relationship with God.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 squats while declaring your trust in God's sovereignty over your life.\""
