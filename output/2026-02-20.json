We may feel like we have all the answers, and that our strength and wisdom are what drive us forward. However, the Bible tells us that pride is a recipe for destruction. When we lead with humility, we open ourselves up to listening to others, seeking guidance, and learning from our mistakes. We recognize that our strength comes not from ourselves, but from God. As we lead our families, workplaces, and communities, let us strive to lead with humility, recognizing that our true strength comes from a deep dependence on Christ.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take a moment of silence to reflect on your current level of humility. Ask God to reveal areas where you need to adjust your attitude and approach.\""
