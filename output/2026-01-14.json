As men of faith, we are called to steel our hearts for the challenges ahead, drawing on the power of the Holy Spirit within us. This power is not a fleeting feeling, but a deep well of strength that enables us to face our fears and overcome obstacles. It is the power of love, that drives us to put others before ourselves, and of self-control, that helps us to make wise decisions in the midst of chaos. As we face the battles of our day, let us draw on this power, relying on God to guide and empower us.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 50 sit-ups while praying for spiritual strength and self-control.\""
