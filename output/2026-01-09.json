We build our lives on shaky ground, thinking that somehow we can sustain ourselves without God's guidance and strength. But the truth is, apart from Jesus Christ, we have no foundation that can withstand the storms of life. Our careers, our relationships, our bank accounts – all of these can be taken away in an instant. But the rock of Christ remains unshakeable, always standing firm. Let us not make the mistake of building our lives on shifting sand, but instead, let us lay our foundation on the solid rock of Jesus Christ. Let us be men who are unshakeable, who stand firm in the midst of chaos and uncertainty.\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Repeat the Lord's Prayer 5 times, asking God to help you build your life on a strong, unshakeable foundation.\""
