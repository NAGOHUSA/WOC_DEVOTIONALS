Trials and tribulations can be overwhelming, causing us to doubt and question God's plan. However, it's in these moments that we must remember to trust in His sovereignty and goodness. James encourages us to view trials as opportunities for growth and strengthening of our faith. It's not about being happy about the trials themselves, but about seeing the purpose behind them. By choosing to trust and have unwavering faith, we can emerge from the storm stronger and more faithful than ever.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run one mile while praying for endurance and trust in God's plan.\""
