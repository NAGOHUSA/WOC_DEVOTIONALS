The world around us can try to conform us to its standards, but as Warriors of Christ, we're called to stand firm in our convictions and be transformed by the power of God's Word. This transformation begins in our minds, where we renew our thoughts and attitudes according to Scripture. As we do, we'll become better equipped to discern God's will and make choices that align with His perfect plan. Let's be intentional about renewing our minds daily, and trust that God will give us the strength and wisdom to overcome any obstacle.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles while declaring out loud your unwavering commitment to God's will.\""
