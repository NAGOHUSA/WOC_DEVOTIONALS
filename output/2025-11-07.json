Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.\" – 2 Corinthians 4:16\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often feel the pressure of the world around us. Our jobs, finances, relationships, and even our physical bodies can make us feel worn out and fragile. But the truth is, our true strength and identity come from within. It's the inner self, renewed by our relationship with God, that gives us the stability and resilience to face any challenge. Just like the apostle Paul, we can choose to not lose heart, even when our outer circumstances seem to be crumbling. Our inner selves are being renewed day by day, and that's what gives us the unshakeable foundation we need to stand firm in the face of adversity.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 squats while repeating the phrase, 'I am renewed by God's strength.'\""
