But as followers of Christ, we can stand firm in our faith, knowing that God is always with us. His presence in our lives gives us the strength and courage to overcome any obstacle. Just like the Israelites in the wilderness, we too can trust in God's guidance and protection. He will help us navigate through the unknown and uphold us when we feel like giving up. When fear creeps in, remember that God is our Rock, our Refuge, and our Deliverer. He will carry us through the toughest of times and give us a sense of peace that passes all understanding.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 sit-ups while declaring, 'I trust in God's strength and I am not afraid.'\""
