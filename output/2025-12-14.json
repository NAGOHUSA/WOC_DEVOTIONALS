But take heart; I have overcome the world.\" – John 16:33\n## Reflection\nAs men of God, we will face storms in life. We will face trials, tribulations, and difficult decisions. But we must remember that we are not alone in the midst of these storms. Jesus has overcome the world, and He is with us always. In Matthew 14:22-33, we see Jesus walking on the water to His disciples. They were in the middle of a storm, but Jesus was not. He was calm and in control. When we feel overwhelmed by the winds of life, we must look to Jesus and remember that He is the Rock upon which we stand. He is our anchor in the storm.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Stand firm in the midst of the storm for 5 minutes today, trusting in Jesus' sovereignty and peace.\""
