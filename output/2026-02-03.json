Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.\" – 2 Corinthians 4:16\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we're often faced with challenges that test our resolve and faith. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and lose sight of our purpose. But the Bible reminds us that our inner strength is being renewed every day. We may feel like we're crumbling on the outside, but our inner man is being transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. This is a promise from God that gives us hope and encouragement to keep moving forward. Just like a building with a solid foundation can withstand earthquakes and storms, our faith can stand firm in the midst of turmoil. Let's anchor our lives in God's word and trust in His sovereignty.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 10 deep breaths while praying for God to renew your inner strength today.\""
