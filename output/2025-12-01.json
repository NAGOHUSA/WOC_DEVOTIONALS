Do not forsake the work of your hands.\" – Psalm 138:8\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we face numerous challenges that can shake our faith and test our resolve. But we must remember that our foundation is not in the shifting sands of this world, but in the unshakeable rock of God's love and purpose. When we anchor our lives in His steadfast love, we can weather any storm that comes our way. We can trust that He will fulfill His purpose in us, even when we can't see the whole picture. This confidence frees us to focus on the work of His hands, rather than our own, and to trust Him to guide us through the darkest of times.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 30 seconds of burpees while declaring God's purpose for your life.\""
