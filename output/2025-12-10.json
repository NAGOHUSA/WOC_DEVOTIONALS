Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\" – Matthew 11:28-29\n\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face storms in our lives – whether it's a difficult season at work, a struggling marriage, or a personal struggle with sin. It's easy to get worn down, to feel like we're shouldering the weight alone. But Jesus offers us a different path. He invites us to come to Him, to take His yoke upon us, and to learn from Him. When we do, we find rest for our souls. We discover that we're not alone, that Jesus is gentle and lowly in heart, and that He's willing to carry our burdens with us.\n\nIn the midst of the storm, let's remember that Jesus is our rock, our refuge, and our strength. Let's come to Him, and let Him give us rest.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 burpees while declaring your dependence on God for strength and rest.\""
