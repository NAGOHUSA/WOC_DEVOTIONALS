You shall seek them and not find them; but those who seek you shall not be put to shame.\" – Isaiah 65:24\n\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face challenges that test our courage and strength. We may feel inadequate or unsure of how to respond in the face of adversity. But as believers, we have a promise from God that we will not be put to shame. We are called to be courageous, just like Joshua, who led the Israelites into battle despite feeling inadequate. We too can have confidence in God's presence and power, knowing that He will be with us in every situation. Let us not be afraid to seek Him and His guidance, trusting that He will lead us through the toughest of times.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 laps while declaring: 'I am not ashamed to seek God's guidance.'\""
