We may feel like we're standing on shaky ground, unsure of what the future holds. But as Christians, we have a source of strength that is unshakeable – God Himself. When we pray and give thanks, we're reminded that our security and confidence come from Him, not from our own abilities or circumstances. Let's not be anxious about what's ahead, but instead, let's run to the throne of God with our requests and concerns. Remember, He is always with us, and His presence is our greatest source of confidence.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 1 mile while reciting Philippians 4:6, focusing on the source of your confidence in God.\""
