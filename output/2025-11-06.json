We may struggle with temptations, feel overwhelmed by our responsibilities, or face opposition from those around us. But in the midst of these challenges, it's easy to lose sight of our strength and our hope. That's why it's so important to remember that we are not alone. We have a God who is our Help and our Salvation. He is with us, guiding us, and empowering us to overcome.\n\nWhen we feel like giving up, when we feel like we're in over our heads, we need to remember that God is our Rock, our Refuge, and our Strength. He is the One who gives us the strength to persevere, to push through, and to overcome.\n\nSo, the next time you're facing adversity, don't look to your own strength or your own abilities. Instead, look to God. He is your Help, your Salvation, and your Deliverer.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles while declaring the truth of Psalm 40:17 over yourself.\""
