We may feel overwhelmed by the responsibilities on our shoulders or uncertain about our purpose in life. But in Philippians 1:21, we see a remarkable declaration of intention from the Apostle Paul. He says that to him, living a life of devotion to Christ is the greatest joy and privilege he could ever know. This verse reminds us that our lives are not just about what we achieve or accomplish, but about the relationships we build and the kingdom we advance. When we put Christ at the center of our lives, we discover a sense of purpose that transcends our circumstances.\n\nAs we navigate the challenges of everyday life, let's choose to live each day with a renewed sense of purpose and passion for Christ. Let's ask ourselves, \"What would Jesus have me do today?\" and then act on it with courage and conviction.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 50 yards while praying for opportunities to share the love of Christ with others.\""
