In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.\" – Proverbs 3:5-6\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face the temptation to rely on our own strength and abilities rather than trusting in God's sovereignty. But when we put our trust in Him, we find that He gives us unshakeable foundations to stand on. This doesn't mean that life will always be easy, but it means that we can face challenges with confidence and peace. We can lean on God's wisdom and guidance, knowing that He will direct our paths and give us the strength we need to overcome obstacles. As we navigate the ups and downs of life, let's remember to trust in the Lord with all our heart and acknowledge Him in all our ways.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 deep breaths, and as you inhale, say 'I trust in God's sovereignty.' As you exhale, say 'I am strengthened by His power.'\""
