We're tasked with building our lives and families on a foundation that's unshakeable, even in the midst of turmoil. Psalm 121 reminds us that our Lord is our Rock, our Guardian, and our Protector. He's the one who keeps us safe, who guides us, and who gives us strength to endure. Our foundation is not built on our own abilities or strengths, but on the unshakeable promises of God.\n\nIn a world that's constantly shifting and changing, it's easy to lose our footing. But when we anchor our lives in Christ, we can face whatever comes our way with confidence. We can trust that He will keep us going out and coming in, through every high and low, every triumph and every trial.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 deep breaths, trusting that God is your Rock and your Refuge.\""
