It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and lose sight of our priorities. But as Christians, we are called to live with intention, to do our work with a sense of purpose and responsibility to the Lord. This means that even in the midst of chaos, we can remain focused on what truly matters. We can ask ourselves, \"Is this task an opportunity to serve the Lord, or am I doing it for my own personal gain?\" By living with intention, we can make a greater impact for the Kingdom and bring glory to God.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 squats while praying for the strength to live with intention in your daily work.\""
