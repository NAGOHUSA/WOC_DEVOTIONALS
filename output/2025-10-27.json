We might feel like we're being pulled in too many directions and struggling to stay focused on what truly matters. But the Bible reminds us that we have a purpose and a mission to fulfill. We are called to live with intention and urgency, knowing that our time on this earth is short. When we feel like we're losing our focus, let's take a step back and remember the Lord's command to \"do it with all our might.\" Let's prioritize our tasks, eliminate distractions, and stay laser-focused on the mission that the Lord has given us.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 minutes to write down your top three priorities for the day, and pray over each one, asking the Lord to give you the strength and clarity to tackle them with all your might.\""
