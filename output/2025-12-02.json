Then your faith will grow strong in the Lord and in your love for each other.\" – Colossians 2:7\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we face numerous challenges in our personal and professional lives. Sometimes, it feels like the world around us is shaking, and we're left wondering if our faith is strong enough to withstand the chaos. However, the Bible reminds us that our faith is not in the circumstances but in the unshakeable God who is our Rock. To grow strong in faith, we must root ourselves deeply in Him, cultivating a love for His Word and a dependence on His strength. As we do this, our faith will grow, and we'll be able to stand firm in the midst of turmoil.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 5 minutes to read and meditate on Psalm 91. Then, go for a 1-mile run while praising God for His presence in your life.\""
