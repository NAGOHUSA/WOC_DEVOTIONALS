We may feel like we're being tossed about like waves on a stormy sea. But God's Word reminds us that He is our Rock, our Shield, and our Refuge. Just like an eagle stirs up its nest to prepare its young for flight, God is constantly stirring up our hearts to prepare us for the battles ahead. He desires us to soar on the updrafts of His love and provision. When the winds of adversity blow, we can trust that our faith is unshakeable, rooted in the solid foundation of God's promises.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Walk 10 steps while declaring your trust in God's sovereignty.\""
