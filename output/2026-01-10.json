But we also know that we are not alone. We have the power of God working through us, guiding and strengthening us for every challenge we face. Paul reminds us to put on the whole armor of God, which includes the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the shield of faith. We are to stand firm in our faith, trusting in God's power and provision. When we feel weak or uncertain, we must remember that our strength comes not from ourselves, but from God. We are to lean on Him, rely on Him, and trust in His goodness and mercy.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 burpees while declaring 'I am strong in God's power, and I can face any battle'.\""
