But the good news is that God's presence is near us, no matter how we feel. He is our rock, our shelter, and our unshakeable foundation. When we feel crushed or defeated, we can run to Him and find comfort in His love and care. He is not a distant God, but a personal Savior who desires a close relationship with us. In times of turmoil, let us remember that God is near, and He is able to save us from our deepest struggles.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 5 minutes to write down your current struggles and doubts, then pray over them and ask God to be your unshakeable foundation. Repeat the phrase 'God is near, and He is able' out loud three times.\""
