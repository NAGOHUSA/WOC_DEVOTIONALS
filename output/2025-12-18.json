Do not forsake the work of your hands.\" – Psalm 138:8\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face trials and challenges that test our faith and resolve. In the midst of uncertainty, it's easy to lose sight of our purpose and the foundation upon which we stand. But the psalmist reminds us that our God is faithful and His love endures forever. He is the unshakeable foundation upon which we can build our lives. When the storms of life come, and they will, we can stand firm in the knowledge that God's purpose for us will be fulfilled.\n\nIn a world that is constantly shifting and changing, it's easy to get caught up in the noise and lose our bearings. But as Warriors of Christ, we must remain grounded in the truth of God's Word and the love of His heart. We must be men who are anchored in the unshakeable foundation of God's steadfast love.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Repeat the verse 'The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your steadfast love, O God, endures forever' 10 times while taking 10 deep breaths, breathing in God's love and exhaling fear and doubt.\""
