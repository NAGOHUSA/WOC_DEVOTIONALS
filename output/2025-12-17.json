But what drives our resolve? Is it fear, or is it the power of the Holy Spirit? In 2 Timothy 1:7, the Apostle Paul reminds us that we don't have to be controlled by fear. Instead, we can tap into God's power, love, and self-discipline. This unshakeable resolve gives us the courage to stand strong in the midst of challenges and to pursue our calling with confidence.\n\nWhen we're faced with uncertainty or opposition, we can choose to lean on our own strength or on the strength of the Lord. Remember, His power is greater than any obstacle we may face. So let's draw on His power and love, and let self-discipline guide us towards our goals.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 5 burpees while declaring your trust in God's power, and take a moment to reflect on an area where you need to exercise self-discipline.\""
