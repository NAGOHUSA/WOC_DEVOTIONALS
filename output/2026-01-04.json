But what does it truly mean to be strong? Is it just physical strength, or is it something more? In this passage, the prophet Isaiah warns that in the end times, men will become wild and untamed, living in the ruins of a fallen world. But what if, instead of becoming like the world, we allow ourselves to be refined in the fire of God's presence? What if we allow Him to strip away our pride, our selfishness, and our fleshly desires, and instead, clothe us in humility, compassion, and love? This is the strength we need as warriors for Christ - not physical strength, but spiritual strength.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 30 seconds to journal your areas of weakness and pray for God to strip away your pride and selfishness, replacing them with humility and compassion.\""
