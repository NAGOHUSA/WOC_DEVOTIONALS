And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.\" – Matthew 7:24-25\n\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often find ourselves facing storms in life – whether it's financial struggles, difficult relationships, or personal struggles with sin. In these moments, it's easy to feel like we're on shaky ground. But the truth is, we have a solid foundation in Jesus Christ. He is our rock, our shelter, and our strength. When we place our faith in Him, we can stand firm against the raging storms of life. We can trust that He will guide us, protect us, and provide for us. So, let's not be like the foolish man who built his house on sand, but rather let's build our lives on the unshakeable foundation of Christ.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 2 miles while thanking God for being your solid rock.\""
