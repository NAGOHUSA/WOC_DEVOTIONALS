It's easy to get rocked by life's storms, but as believers, we have the opportunity to stand firm like rocks, unshaken by the winds of adversity. Remember the promises of God, hold onto His Word, and stand firm on the traditions that have been passed down to you. Don't let the world dictate your values and morals; instead, let God's Word shape your character and inform your decisions. As you stand firm, you'll become a source of strength and inspiration to those around you.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 10 minutes on the treadmill while praying for God to give you the strength to stand firm in your faith.\""
