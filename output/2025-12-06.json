The cross is not just a symbol of sacrifice and redemption, but also a source of strength and courage. When we fix our eyes on the cross, we are reminded of the ultimate victory that has already been won for us. We are no longer bound by the weights and weaknesses of the world, but are freed to live a life that is surrendered to God.\n\nIn a world that often values strength and power, we must not forget that our true strength comes not from our own abilities or accomplishments, but from the power of the cross. As we go about our daily battles, let us remember to keep our eyes fixed on the cross, and trust in the power of God to give us the strength we need to overcome any obstacle.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 burpees while praising God for the power of the cross. Remember, our strength comes not from our own abilities, but from the power of Christ.\""
