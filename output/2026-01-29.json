It's easy to get discouraged when we're hit with unexpected obstacles or setbacks. However, we must remember that these trials are opportunities for growth and refinement. James reminds us that the testing of our faith produces steadfastness, a quality that only comes from enduring difficult circumstances. When we face adversity, we have a choice to make: we can give up or we can draw closer to God. Let us choose to see our trials as opportunities to build a stronger foundation of faith, one that will carry us through even the most trying times.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 15 squats while praying for the strength to endure trials.\""
