We may feel like giving up or losing our footing in the midst of turmoil. But as believers, we can find comfort in knowing that God is working in us and will bring our lives to completion according to His plan. This verse reminds us that our strength and stability come from Him, not from our own abilities.\n\nJust as a house built on a solid foundation can withstand the fiercest storms, we too can stand firm in the midst of life's challenges when our faith is rooted in Jesus. So let us look to God as our rock, our refuge, and our strength, and trust that He will see us through.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Today, take 10 minutes to write down 3 things you're thankful for in your life. Then, write down 3 areas where you need God's help and strength.\""
