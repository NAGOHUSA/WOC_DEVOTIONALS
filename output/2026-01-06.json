And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.\" – Matthew 7:24-25\n\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face challenges that can shake our foundations and test our resolve. Whether it's the pressure of work, the strain of family life, or the temptation of sin, we need a rock-solid foundation to stand firm. The Bible teaches us that a wise man builds his house on the rock, not on shifting sands. This requires us to anchor our lives in the Word of God, to seek wisdom and guidance from His truth, and to prioritize our relationship with Him above all else. As we face the storms of life, may we be men who stand firm on the unshakeable foundations of our faith.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 50 reps of burpees while praying for wisdom and strength to stand firm in your faith.\""
