And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.\" â€“ Matthew 7:24-25 (ESV)\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face storms in life that threaten to shake our foundation. But what if our foundation is unshakeable? What if we've built our lives on the rock of Jesus Christ? When the winds of adversity blow, we can stand firm, unmovable, and unshakeable. This is the promise of Jesus to those who hear His words and do them. Let us make sure our foundation is solid, rooted in God's Word and the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 400 meters while declaring your dependence on God for strength and stability.\""
