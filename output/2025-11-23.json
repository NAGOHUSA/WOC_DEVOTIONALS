Whether it's at work, in our relationships, or in our personal struggles, we're constantly tested. But God hasn't given us a spirit of fear or doubt. Instead, He's given us a spirit of power, love, and self-control. This means we can face adversity with confidence, knowing that God is with us and in us.\n\nWhen we feel overwhelmed, we can choose to trust in God's strength and provision. We can pray for wisdom, courage, and faith to carry us through difficult times. And we can remember that we're not alone – we're part of a larger community of believers who are praying for and supporting each other.\n\nSo let's rise up as warriors of Christ and face our challenges head-on, armed with faith and the knowledge that God is with us.\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 squats while repeating Psalm 27:1: 'The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?\""
