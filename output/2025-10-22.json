Again, the Lord speaks to you about rest, and this is the third time I am telling you: in the third year put out the crops.\" â€“ Deuteronomy 32:35-36 (NIV)\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face challenges that test our faith. We may feel like our world is crumbling, and we don't know how to hold on. But what does God say? He tells us that He will avenge, that He will repay. He tells us that He is in control, that He is sovereign. We must trust in His goodness and His love, even when we don't understand what is happening. We must remember that our faith is not based on feelings or circumstances, but on the truth of God's Word. As we face the battles of life, we must anchor ourselves in the truth of God's promises.\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Stand up and walk for 10 minutes while declaring out loud that God is in control of your life.\""
