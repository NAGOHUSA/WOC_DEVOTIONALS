We're surrounded by the world's influence, which can lead us astray from God's plan. But as Christians, we have the power to resist this temptation and stand firm in our faith. It's a constant battle, but with our minds renewed by God's Word, we can discern His will and make choices that align with it. Let's not conform to the world's standards, but instead, be transformed by the power of Christ. This transformation will enable us to stand strong in the face of adversity and live a life that honors God.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 minutes to meditate on Romans 12:2 and pray for the mind of Christ to be renewed in you.\""
