But in these times of turmoil, we must remember that our faith is being tested, and that's where our strength comes from. James reminds us to consider trials as opportunities for joy, not just because of the outcome, but because of the growth we experience in our walk with God. When we stand firm in adversity, we're not just enduring the storm; we're allowing it to refine us, making us more like Christ. Our response to adversity is a choice, and it's a choice that shapes our character.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 2 miles while praying for God to give you wisdom to face the challenges ahead.\""
