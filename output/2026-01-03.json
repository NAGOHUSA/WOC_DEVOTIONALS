It's easy to give up or lose our footing when the winds of adversity blow strong. But as Christians, we have a responsibility to stand firm in our faith and share the hope of the gospel with others. Just like Paul, we've been called to suffer for the sake of the gospel, but we don't have to do it alone. We have the power of God working in us, giving us the strength to persevere. Remember, your worth isn't based on your actions or accomplishments, but on God's purpose and grace for your life.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles today, not for your own glory, but to honor God with your body and share the hope of the gospel with those around you.\""
