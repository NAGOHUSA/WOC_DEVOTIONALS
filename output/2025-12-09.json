It's easy to get swayed by the opinions of others or the circumstances that surround us. But the Word of God reminds us that His truth stands firm, no matter what. When we take refuge in Him, we find a shield that protects us from the attacks of the enemy. We don't have to be moved by every wind of doctrine or every storm that comes our way. Instead, we can stand firm on the rock of our salvation, trusting in the promises of God. This is not a call to be ignorant of the world around us, but to be rooted in the truth of God's Word, so that we can stand firm in the face of adversity.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 10 squats while declaring that you stand firm on the rock of God's truth.\""
