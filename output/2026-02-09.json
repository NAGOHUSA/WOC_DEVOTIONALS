The enemy is relentless in his pursuit of our souls, but God has given us the tools to stand strong. In Ephesians 6, Paul outlines the armor of God, which includes the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the shield of faith. To be strengthened for battle, we must put on this armor and remember that our victory is not our own, but through Christ's power and might. When we feel weak and inadequate, we must look to the Lord for our strength. He is our Rock, our Refuge, and our Redeemer.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 laps around your house or block, praying for God's strength to overcome temptation and spiritual battles.\""
