But as followers of Christ, we're called to be different. We're called to be transformed by the power of God's Word and to live according to His will. This requires us to be intentional about our thoughts, our actions, and our decisions. It requires us to be men of conviction and character. So, let's ask the Lord to reveal to us areas where we need to be transformed, and let's commit to living out our faith with courage and integrity.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 25 squats while praying for the strength to stand firm in your faith.\""
