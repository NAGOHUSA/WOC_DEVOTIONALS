We may feel weighed down by the demands of work, family, and life. But Jesus invites us to come to Him, to rest in His presence and find the strength we need to carry on. In His presence, we are not alone in our struggles. We have a Savior who understands our weaknesses and offers us rest. Just as a warrior relies on his armor to protect him in battle, we can rely on God's strength to carry us through the tough times. Let us come to Jesus, and let Him give us the rest we need to face the challenges ahead.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 squats while proclaiming, 'I come to You, Lord, and find rest in Your strength.'\""
