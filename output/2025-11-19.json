Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.\" – 2 Corinthians 4:16\n## Reflection\nAs Warriors of Christ, we face various battles in life - spiritual, emotional, and physical. It's easy to lose heart when we're worn out, tired, and discouraged. However, the Bible reminds us that our inner selves are being renewed day by day. This means that even in the midst of chaos, we have the promise of a new perspective, a fresh start, and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThis unwavering resolve comes from our faith in Jesus Christ. He is our rock, our refuge, and our strength. We can trust in His power to transform us, to give us the strength we need to press on, and to overcome the obstacles that stand in our way.\n\nSo, when you feel like giving up, when you're exhausted and worn out, remember that your inner self is being renewed. Draw on the strength of the Lord, and let His resolve be your guiding light.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 50 squats while declaring, 'I am being renewed day by day, in the strength of the Lord.'\""
