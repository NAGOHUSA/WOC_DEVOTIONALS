Let me dwell in your tent forever!\" – [Psalm 91:2]\n## Reflection\nAs men of faith, we often face storms that test our resolve and threaten to shake us. But we serve a God who is unshakable, and He desires to be our rock in the midst of turmoil. In Psalm 91:2, we're encouraged to anchor our faith in God's steadfast love, which means trusting in His unwavering commitment to us. Just as a high tower provides shelter from the storm, God's love is our safe haven, where we can find refuge and peace. Let us fix our eyes on Him, and not be swayed by the tempests that rage around us.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three areas where you feel shaken, and then pray for God to be your rock in each one. Ask Him to fill you with His steadfast love and peace.\""
