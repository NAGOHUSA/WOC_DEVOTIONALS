Whether it's a difficult conversation at work, a personal struggle, or a family crisis, we're tempted to let anxiety take over. But God's Word reminds us that we don't have to be controlled by fear. Instead, we can present our requests to Him with thanksgiving and prayer. When we focus on His presence and power, we find the courage to face the day with confidence. So, let's choose to trust in God's goodness and sovereignty, and let His peace guide us through the ups and downs of life.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three things you're thankful for this morning, and pray for God's guidance and strength as you face the day ahead.\""
