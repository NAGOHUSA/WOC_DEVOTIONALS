We let our priorities be shaped by what others think we should do, rather than seeking God's will. But as Warriors of Christ, we must be focused on the mission God has given us. We must be transformed by the renewal of our minds, constantly seeking to understand and obey God's will. This isn't about trying to be better than others, but about being faithful to the call of God on our lives. Let's not be swayed by the world's influences, but instead, let's be transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles while praying for clarity and focus in your mission from God.\""
