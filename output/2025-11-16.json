And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.\" – Matthew 7:24-25\n\n## Reflection\nAs men, we often face challenges that test our strength, resolve, and character. But the question is, what foundation are we building our lives on? Are we anchored in the Word of God, or are we like a house built on shifting sand? When the storms of life come, will we be able to stand firm, or will we crumble under the pressure? Today, let's take a closer look at our foundation and make sure it's built on the rock of God's Word. Let's pray for wisdom and discernment to make choices that honor God and build a strong foundation for our lives.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 10 deep knee bends while praying for strength to withstand the challenges of life.\""
