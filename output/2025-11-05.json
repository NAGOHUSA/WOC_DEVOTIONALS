However, we must remember that the God we serve is a God of strength and power. He has given us a spirit that enables us to face any challenge with confidence, love, and self-control.\n\nWhen we feel like giving up or backing down, let's recall the countless times God has helped us overcome adversity in the past. Let's meditate on His promises and remind ourselves that He is always with us, guiding and strengthening us for the battles ahead.\n\nIn the midst of uncertainty, let's choose to trust in God's power, rather than our own. Let's ask Him to fill us with His Spirit, that we may be equipped to stand firm and fight the good fight of faith.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 50 burpees while declaring your trust in God's power over your own fears and doubts.\""
