Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\" – Joshua 1:9\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we face many challenges in life. We face opposition, fear, and doubt, but we must not let these things shake our faith. We have a promise from God that He is with us, and that should give us the strength and courage we need to face whatever comes our way. It's easy to be strong when things are going well, but it's when things get tough that we really see what we're made of. We must be intentional about standing on the promises of God, even when it feels like everything is falling apart. We must be willing to be unshaken in our faith, even when the world around us is shaking.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 10 deep breaths while declaring your trust in God's presence.\""
