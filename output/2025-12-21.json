We're not guaranteed a life free from trials, but we are promised that God uses these trials to strengthen our faith. It's in the midst of challenges that we discover our character, our resilience, and our dependence on Him.\n\nIn the midst of uncertainty, it's easy to lose sight of our purpose and our trust in God. But when we anchor ourselves in His Word and His promises, we're able to stand firm even when the storms rage around us. Let's not be discouraged by the trials that come our way, but instead, let's see them as opportunities to grow in our faith and to become stronger warriors for Christ.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 5 minutes to write down 3 ways you'll trust God in the midst of adversity today.\""
