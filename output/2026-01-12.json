It's easy to get caught up in the world's demands and lose sight of what's truly important. But as Christians, we're called to be different. We're called to be transformed by the renewal of our minds, to think differently, to prioritize differently.\n\nThis means we need discipline. We need to be intentional about how we spend our time, our energy, and our resources. We need to be willing to say no to things that don't align with God's will and yes to things that do. This isn't always easy, but it's necessary if we want to live a life that honors God.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three things you're committing to give up for the next week to prioritize your relationship with God.\""
