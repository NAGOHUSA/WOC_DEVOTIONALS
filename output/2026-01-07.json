Temptation can come in many forms – from social media to seductive relationships, or even the temptation to give up on our faith. However, as followers of Christ, we have a choice. We can choose to let the world shape us, or we can let God transform us through His Word and Spirit.\n\nIn Romans 12:2, the Apostle Paul reminds us that our minds need to be renewed in order to discern God's will. This means actively seeking to understand and apply God's Word to our lives, and asking for His guidance in the midst of temptation. Remember, transformation is a process that takes time, effort, and surrender to God's will.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three areas in your life where you feel tempted to conform to the world, and pray for God's transformation in those areas. Take one step today to apply God's Word to one of those areas.\""
