It can take many forms – from the subtle whispers of self-doubt to the blatant allurements of sin. But God has given us the power to overcome temptation through the renewal of our minds. This means actively choosing to think on the things that are true, noble, and pure (Philippians 4:8). It means filling our minds with the Word of God and meditating on its truth. As we do, we will become more discerning and better equipped to choose God's will over the will of the flesh.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 minutes to journal about a recent temptation you faced. How did you respond? What could you have done differently? Ask God to help you renew your mind and make choices that are pleasing to Him.\""
