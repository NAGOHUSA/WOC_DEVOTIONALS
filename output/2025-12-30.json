In the midst of these challenges, it's easy to get caught up in worry and anxiety. But God's Word reminds us to stand firm in the storm by presenting our requests to Him with thanksgiving. This means that even in the midst of turmoil, we choose to focus on God's goodness and faithfulness. We remember that He is our rock, our refuge, and our strength. As we pray and petition Him with thanksgiving, we'll find peace and strength to face whatever comes our way.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Write down three things you're thankful for today and pray about them with a friend.\""
