It's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of emotions and lose sight of what's truly important. But as warriors of Christ, we must stand firm in our faith and hold fast to the traditions that have been passed down to us. This doesn't mean we're resistant to change or inflexible, but rather that we're committed to the timeless truths of Scripture that have guided us thus far. By standing firm, we're able to navigate the storms of life with confidence and assurance, knowing that our foundation is solid and unshakeable.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 20 squats while declaring, 'I will stand firm in my faith, no matter what.'\""
