But before we can face these battles, we must first prepare our minds and our hearts. In Romans 12:2, the Apostle Paul reminds us that we must not conform to the ways of the world, but instead be transformed by the power of God. This transformation begins in our minds, as we renew our thoughts and attitudes to align with God's will.\n\nAs we step into the battle today, let us remember that we are not fighting with our own strength, but with the power of God working through us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, and let us be transformed by the power of His love.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles while praying for the transformation of your mind and heart.\""
