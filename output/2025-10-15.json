He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.\" – 2 Thessalonians 3:3\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we face battles every day – battles of faith, battles of discipline, and battles of obedience. But we don't have to face them alone. Our Heavenly Father is faithful, and He has promised to establish and guard us against the evil one. This means that we can stand firm in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, knowing that God is with us. We can trust in His strength, not our own. We can trust in His wisdom, not our own. And we can trust in His love, which is greater than any fear or doubt that may arise.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Repeat this verse 10 times while standing up straight and looking to God for strength: 'But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.'\""
