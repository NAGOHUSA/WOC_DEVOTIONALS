Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.\" – Colossians 2:7-8\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we often face challenges that can shake our faith. But we must remember that our faith is rooted in Jesus Christ, who is the rock of our salvation. Just as a tree's roots grow deep into the earth, our faith must also grow deep into Christ, so that we can weather any storm. This requires us to be rooted in the Word of God and to build our lives on the principles of the Bible. As we continue to live our lives in Christ, we must also be strengthened in the faith, and this can be done by remembering the teachings we have received and by overflowing with thankfulness to God for all He has done for us.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 5 minutes to write down 5 things you are thankful for today. Pray over each one and give thanks to God.\""
