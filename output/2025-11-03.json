But it's easy to get caught up in the noise and distractions around us, losing sight of the battle ahead. The Apostle Paul reminds us to be transformed by the renewal of our minds, to test and discern what is the will of God. This means being intentional about how we think, what we focus on, and how we respond to the challenges we face. In a world that often values conformity and fitting in, we must stand out as men who are transformed by the power of God.\n\n## Daily Challenge\nRun 5 miles while praying for clarity and discernment in your decisions."
