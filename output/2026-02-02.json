The belt of truth is a reminder that our words and actions should be grounded in the unchanging truth of God's Word. The breastplate of righteousness protects us from the attacks of the enemy, and the readiness of the gospel of peace gives us the confidence to face any challenge that comes our way. Let's make sure we're putting on the right armor each day, so we can stand strong in the face of adversity.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 5 miles while declaring the truth of God's Word over your life.\""
