Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.\" – 2 Corinthians 4:16\n## Reflection\nAs men, we are often called to stand firm in the face of adversity. We are faced with challenges that test our resolve, our faith, and our character. It can be easy to give up, to lose heart, and to let our circumstances define us. But as followers of Christ, we have the strength and the courage to persevere.\n\nThe Bible tells us that our outer self may be weak, but our inner self, our spirit, is being renewed day by day. This is a powerful reminder that we are not alone, that we are not weak, and that we are not defeated. We are children of God, and He is our strength in weakness.\n\nSo, when the going gets tough, and it will get tough, let us not lose heart. Let us draw on the strength of our Lord, and let us stand firm in our faith. Let us be unwavering in our resolve to follow Him, no matter what challenges we may face.\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Run 1 mile while praying for God's strength to carry you through difficult times.\""
