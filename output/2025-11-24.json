But the Bible tells us that we have been given a spirit of power, not fear. This power is not just for external battles, but also for internal struggles. It's the power to overcome anxiety, self-doubt, and fear. When we put our trust in God, we can face any situation with confidence. We can be unshakeable, like a rock that stands firm against the storms of life. This confidence doesn't come from our own strength, but from God's power working within us. As we walk with God, we can experience the transformation of our hearts and minds, and become the men He has called us to be.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Take 10 deep breaths, and repeat out loud, 'I am strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.'\""
