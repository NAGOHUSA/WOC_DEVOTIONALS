For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" â€“ Hebrews 12:2\n\n## Reflection\nAs warriors of Christ, we must keep our eyes on the mission and our hearts set on the prize. It's easy to get sidetracked by the challenges and obstacles of everyday life. But as we journey through the battles of this world, we must remember that our focus is on Him, not the circumstances around us. Just as Jesus endured the cross for the joy that awaited Him, we too can endure the trials of life when we keep our eyes fixed on the reward. Don't let the distractions of this world take your eyes off the prize. Stay focused on the mission, and trust that God will give you the strength to overcome any obstacle.\n\n## Daily Challenge\n\"Do 10 squats while declaring your focus on Jesus. Repeat the phrase 'My eyes are fixed on Jesus' with each rep.\""
